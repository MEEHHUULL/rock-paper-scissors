# rock-paper-scissors

<!-- This is going to be my first javascript project. I am going to make a rock, paper, scissors game. Not really sure how this is going to go but I do know I need to plan.  -->

<!-- I need to think first about how this game works in real life and how it would work on a computer. I need to construct some basic pseudocode first and then go ahead and try and code it. -->

<!-- Here goes nothing! -->


<!-- Not bad i guess.. it took me a while to do but i think i really understood a lot about planning and function usage. Happy days. I didn't add a tally tracker to it otherwise all good. -->

<!-- Tally tracker add on -  -->
